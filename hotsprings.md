Who doesn't love lazing around in a secluded warm pool of water? This is my guide to some amazing hot water springs I have visited.

[Big Bend National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_National_Park) is at the US-Mexico border separated by the Rio Grande in Texas. While the park has numerous attractions worth visiting, our focus is the hot water spring! <br>
This pool of bliss is right next to the Rio Grande that flows through the vast desert Chihuahuan desert. You can laze in both hot and cold water; just don't swim across!
