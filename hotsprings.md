Who doesn't love lazing around in a secluded warm pool of water? This is my guide to some amazing hot water springs I have visited.

[Big Bend National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_National_Park) is at the US-Mexico border separated by the Rio Grande in Texas. While the park has numerous attractions worth visiting, our focus is the hot water spring! <br>
This pool of bliss is right next to the Rio Grande that flows through the vast desert Chihuahuan desert. You can laze in both hot and cold water; just don't swim across!

[Hot Sulphur Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Sulphur_Springs,_Colorado) is a neat two hour drive from Denver through the scenic I-70. The spa has nearly 10 pools with various temperatures; the hottest is about 115F and <br>
the coolest, is well, a normal chlorine pool! :-) The Colorado river scenic byway is also a part of the drive to the spa and the river itself, looks like a tiny creek from the springs.
