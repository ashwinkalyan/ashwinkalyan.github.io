This page contains pointers to some really good tutorials that I found really useful in getting a hang on the subject: 
- [Submodular Functions Maximization Problems](https://www.openu.ac.il/personal_sites/moran-feldman/publications/Handbook2018.pdf) <br>
Niv Buchbinder and Moran Feldman <br>
[Provides a succinct and at the same time, a thorough description of the subject.]
- [Lecture Notes on Stochastic Modeling](http://www.columbia.edu/~ks20/stochastic-I/stochastic-I.html) <br> 
Karl Sigman <br>
