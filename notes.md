This page contains pointers to some really good tutorials that I found really useful in getting a hang on the subject: 
- [Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Algorithms](https://rltheorybook.github.io/rl_monograph_AJK.pdf) <br>
Alekh Agarwal, Nan Jiang and Sham Kakade <br>
[Also see Nan Jiang's excellent [notes](https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/cs598/)]
- [Submodular Functions Maximization Problems](https://www.openu.ac.il/personal_sites/moran-feldman/publications/Handbook2018.pdf) <br>
Niv Buchbinder and Moran Feldman <br>
[Provides a succinct and at the same time, a thorough description of the subject.]
- [Lecture Notes on Stochastic Modeling](http://www.columbia.edu/~ks20/stochastic-I/stochastic-I.html) <br> 
Karl Sigman <br>
- [Convex Optimization: Algorithms and Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4980) <br>
Sebastian Bubeck <br>
