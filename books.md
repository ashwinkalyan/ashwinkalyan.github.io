The reason to put this list out on my webpage is of course, reaching out to like-minded people. 
But, the bigger driving force is to get my reading habit (that has taken a severe hit since grad school) back. 
Also, inspired from lists of [Dheeraj](https://dheerajmn.mit.edu/personal/) and [Anup Rao](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/books.html).
